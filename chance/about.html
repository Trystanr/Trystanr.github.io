				<p class="about-paragraph">Chancelor Bennett (born April 16, 1993), known professionally as Chance the Rapper, is an American hip hop recording artist from the West Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. In 2013, he began to gain major recognition following the release of his second mixtape, Acid Rap. Chance is also a member of the Chicago collective Save Money with frequent collaborator Vic Mensa, and he experimented as the lead vocalist for the band The Social Experiment.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">10 day</h2>

				<p class="about-paragraph">At Jones College Prep High School, some of his teachers ridiculed his aspirations to become a musician.Following a 10-day suspension in early 2011 during his senior year for possessing marijuana on campus, Bennett recorded his first full-length project, a mixtape titled 10 Day (also known as #10Day). In December 2011, he released a song titled "Windows", and publicly announced his 10 Day project. After the song's release, in February 2012, Bennett was highlighted as one of Complex magazine's "10 New Chicago Rappers to Watch Out For." Bennett says he spent "about eight months recording, writing and making connections off of the hunger to put out something." After about a year’s time of working on the tape, Bennett released it on April 3, 2012 and it has since been downloaded over 300,000 times via Datpiff. The mixtape was well received locally and would help Bennett make connections with producers such as Chuck Inglish, Kenny Jame$ and Blended Babies. The mixtape would also grab the attention of Forbes magazine, which featured it in the publication's Cheap Tunes column. Prior to writing and recording 10 Day, Chance The Rapper recorded the mixtape Good Enough and The Back to School Pack EP respectively.</p>

The following March, Chance was featured on Skrillex's remix of Hundred Waters' "Show Me Love".[52] Chance met with President Obama at the White House on April 16, 2016, to discuss My Brother's Keeper Challenge initiative with other musicians included Alicia Keys, Busta Rhymes, Janelle Monáe, J.
