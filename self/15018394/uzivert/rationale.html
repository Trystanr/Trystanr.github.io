        You can view the video in most video players in the root/vid/final.mp4
        <br>
        <br>
        The colour I used in this piece consists of a white and purple foreground set upon a black background. This is intended to represent the album cover. The song was released as a single, so does not have an inset. Uzi Vert makes use of the harsh purples and black contrasts in many of his videos, seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcyFfcJbyeM">here</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Also seen in his videos is his stylistic usage of the <a href="http://greenlabel.com/lil-uzi-vert-vs-the-world-cover-stories/">scott pilgrim</a> visual aesthetic, which Vert employs on most of his album covers. I made use of this aesthetic by introducing the viewer to the very first image, being a character bearing resemblance to Vert while still using the SP aesthetic. The viewer knows that it is Lil Uzi Vert as the artist has purple hair and wears very flashy jewellry, seen by the gold bands on his wrists. The character is seen to be playing a guitar along with the audio. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The background has falling money. The main theme of the song implies that Verts friends are all dead. This references the fact that United States currency has images of dead presidents printed on them. Vert is stating that these dead presidents are his only friends as all the other people only care about his money, therefore his money would be his only true friend. While the effect may be a little intense and ongoing, I felt like it was necessary to overemphasize the fact that money was a main theme in the piece. The fact that majority of the video has the falling money is an indicator that this video deals heavily on the theme of the negative influence of money on happiness.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first introduction of text is the message chat overlay seen at the beginning. The conversation is between Vert and one of his "friends". The friend asks Vert if he is okay, to which he replies that he is, and that his money is also alright. Without being asked, he mentions his money. This immediately triggers the viewer into the thought, "all he cares about is money".
        The reason I used the very clean lines of a text message and chat is to heavily contrast how he actually feels in comparison to what he is actually thinking. His projection of himself (the texts replying that he is okay) has a completely different atmosphere to the toned blues and sad look in the background, as well as the audio being extremely emotional. You hear the pain in his voice which is completely opposite to the content of his words, also represented in the visuals.
        <br>
        <br>
        The shattering of the image of Vert is representative of his own breaking point, the introduction of drums helps portray this image.
        <br>
        <br>
        I then introduce the lyrics by using the shattered background as a mask. This gets the viewer comfortable with the transition from image into text and also symbolies Vert still being the same even after he was broken. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Phantom text makes use of the official <a href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en-GB/phantom.html">Rolls Royce intro animation</a>, as well as the Off White animation implementing the official <a href="https://www.off---white.com/">Off White logo</a> style. The Off white then transitions into a mountain ski slope, where the text is offset to represent it skiing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, a cover is presented to the user, with the music fading out in the background, leaving the viewer wanting more, thusly achieving the goal set forth as being a promotional content.
