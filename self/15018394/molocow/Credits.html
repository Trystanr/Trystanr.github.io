    	<h1>Rationale</h1>
    	<p>After working on this project consistently throughout the first half of this semester, I have learnt a great deal. From the planning stages, the client and I worked together to determine the best means of action and workflow to create the final product. From selecting the logo to determining the theme and style, Dana and I worked hand in hand to complete this product. The final product closely represents what was stated in the final brief, and accomplishes the aim of the task. </p>
    	<p>The colour palette chosen here makes heavy use of deep blues and reds, to give the user a space-like feel. The only exception to these colours are when the user sees the cows, this is shown in peach tones, to give the feeling of relaxation (as the cows are then seen as natural in contrast to the product). I decided to split up the scenes into multiple files and use my programming expertise to link them together. I would have liked the transitions to be smoother, but my tools limited me. </p>
    	<p>In conclusion, I feel like the final product can be seen as a whole representative of the brief set out.</p>
