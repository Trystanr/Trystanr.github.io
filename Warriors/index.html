		<h1 class="row-header">Programs</h1>
		<p>We recognize that a “one size fits all” approach to soccer is, for a number of reasons, not always effective. We therefore offer a choice of programs.The appropriate program for a particular player will depend on a number of factors including a player’s age, time constraints, motivation for playing and current skill level . We strongly believe that with the right guidance every player, whatever their skill levels, can make dramatic improvements.</p>
